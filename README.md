# React JS Infinite Scroll | React Interview Questions | Machine Coding Round

Welcome! In this video, we'll show you how to add infinite scroll with React JS. Infinite scroll is a mechanism that dynamically loads data as needed, ensuring optimal performance by avoiding critical issues. This feature is especially common in social media applications, but it can be intimidating to set up.

We'll break down the process, making it clear that setting up infinite scrolling is easier than it seems. Infinite scrolling is essentially a form of pagination that doesn't require users to click a button. Instead, we hook it up to the scroll event.

To make this efficient, we'll use the IntersectionObserver API, which checks when the last element of our list is loaded without compromising performance. Join us to learn how to seamlessly implement infinite scrolling in your React applications!
